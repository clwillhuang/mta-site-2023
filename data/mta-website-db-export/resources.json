This Case Competition will allow students to use the knowledge gained from the workshops to create a FPL team.\n\nStudents will present their FPL team to a panel of judges using relevant stats (with Power BI) and a regression model (with R). Students will use a dataset that include previous yearsâ€™ data and will get a chance to see their model in action when they create a FPL team based on the best players according to their models.\n\n## Who can participate?\n\nGroups of 4 will compete in the league and will be able to see other teams progress throughout the competition.","initialPublish":{"$date":"2023-10-12T18:08:49.352Z"},"lastEdit":{"$date":"2023-10-12T18:08:49.352Z"},"description":"This Case Competition will allow students to use the knowledge gained from data analytics workshops to create the ultimate FPL team.","__v":0}
