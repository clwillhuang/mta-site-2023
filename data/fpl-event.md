MTA in collaboration with The BRIDGE is thrilled to announce our Data Analytics: Case Competition ⚽️🏆

📝This Case Competition will allow students to use the knowledge gained from the workshops to create a FPL team.

👬👭Students will present their FPL team to a panel of judges using relevant stats (with Power BI) and a regression model (with R). Students will use a dataset that include previous years’ data and will get a chance to see their model in action when they create a FPL team based on the best players according to their models.

🥇Groups of 4 will compete in the league and will be able to see other teams progress throughout the competition.
